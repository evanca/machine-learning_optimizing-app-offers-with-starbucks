### Introduction

Project goal is to deploy two different machine learning models that could potentially allow Starbucks to model their customers and personalize marketing efforts for much greater effectiveness. There are 3 raw data files - portfolio.json (10 offers x 6 fields), profile.json (17000 users x 5 fields) and transcript.json (306648 events x 4 fields). The files are not very straightforward to wrangle and require some creativity to process. 

Please refer to [PROJECT REPORT](https://evanca.github.io/machine-learning_optimizing-app-offers-with-starbucks/) for a high-level overview of the project.


### Requirements

Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instance (requires AWS account)

OR

1. Anaconda with latest Python 3 version (includes Python, Jupyter Notebook, and commonly used packages)
2. Amazon SageMaker Python SDK


### Installation

If you want to run the files in Amazon SageMaker Console, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/gs-console.html).

OR

To install SageMaker Python SDK [see this repo](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk#installing-the-sagemaker-python-sdk).

No other module installation is needed as long as you already have Anaconda on your machine. You can get it [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
